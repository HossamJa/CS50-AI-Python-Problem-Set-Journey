# CS50AI-Python-Challenges

## About
My solutions to CS50’s Python AI problem sets, covering search, optimization, and machine learning. Each folder contains a Python solution, explanation, and demo for a specific problem, showcasing my learning journey in AI.

## 📚 Course Overview

CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python introduces key AI concepts through hands-on projects. The course covers topics such as search algorithms, knowledge representation, machine learning, neural networks, and natural language processing. Each project includes one or two problems that apply these concepts to practical scenarios. This repository documents my progress, with each problem implemented in Python 3.12 and accompanied by a README explaining the solution and a demo of its functionality.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized with each problem in its own folder, named in lowercase to match the problem’s name (e.g., `/degrees/`). Each folder contains the Python script(s), a README.md with an explanation, and a demo (e.g., screenshots, videos, or output examples). The current structure is:

```

## 🛠️ Projects and Problems

Below is a list of the projects and their associated problems, with links to their respective folders. Completed problems include a detailed README and demo in their folders.

### Project 0: Search
- **[Degrees](/degrees/)**: Finds the shortest path between two actors based on movies they’ve appeared in together, using graph search algorithms.
- **[Tic-Tac-Toe](/tic-tac-toe/)**: Implements an AI to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally using the Minimax algorithm.

### Project 1: Knowledge
- **[Knights](/knights/)**: Solves logic puzzles involving knights and knaves using knowledge representation and inference.
- **[Minesweeper](/minesweeper/)**: Implements an AI to play Minesweeper by making safe moves and updating knowledge based on game state.

### Project 2: Uncertainty
- **[PageRank](/pagerank/)**: Simulates Google’s PageRank algorithm to rank web pages based on link structure.
- **[Heredity](/heredity/)**: Calculates probabilities of genetic traits in a family tree using Bayesian networks.

### Project 3: Optimization
- **[Crossword](/crossword/)**: Generates a crossword puzzle by fitting words into a grid, using constraint satisfaction techniques.

### Project 4: Learning
- **[Shopping](/shopping/)**: Predicts whether a user will make an online purchase based on features, using machine learning classification.
- **[Nim](/nim/)**: Implements an AI to play the game of Nim, learning optimal moves through reinforcement learning.

### Project 5: Neural Networks
- **[Traffic](/traffic/)**: Recognizes traffic signs in images using a convolutional neural network.

### Project 6: Language
- **[Parser](/parser/)**: Parses sentences to extract meaning using natural language processing techniques.
- **[Attention](/attention/)**: Implements an attention-based model for tasks like machine translation or text generation.

## 🚀 How to Run

Each problem can be run by navigating to its folder and executing the Python script. For example:

```bash
cd degrees
python degrees.py
```

Some problems may require dependencies (e.g., `numpy`, `tensorflow`, or others specified in the problem’s README). Install them using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Check each problem’s README for specific instructions, including any input files, command-line arguments, or setup steps. Demos (e.g., screenshots or videos) are included in each folder to illustrate the solution’s functionality.

## 📝 Reflections

This repository captures my journey through CS50’s AI course, starting with my first problems in Project 0: Degrees and Tic-Tac-Toe. Each problem builds on the previous, deepening my understanding of AI concepts and their applications. From graph search to game-playing AI, these projects challenge me to think algorithmically and creatively. I’ll continue updating this repository as I complete each problem, documenting my growth as an AI practitioner.
